                According to the principles at City Dental Care, everyone should
                have access to an attractive, confident smile. Composite bonding
                is a quick and budget-friendly treatment that gives patients new

                dentists in Edinburgh incorporate the latest procedures and
                materials to leave our patients with natural, long-lasting
                smiles.

                What is Composite Bonding?
              </h3>
              <p >
                It is a cosmetic dental treatment that directly fixes any
                blemishes by applying a tooth-coloured resin to the tooth. This
                resin is fashioned and hardened to harmonise with your natural
                teeth. Composite bonding can enhance your smile temporarily or
                permanently at any point on your teeth.
